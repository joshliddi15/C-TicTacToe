# C-TicTacToe

# Overview

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in C# which includes the ability to store win results to a csv file and retrieve them to display in a simple leaderboard at the end of each game.

This program was created to increase my familiarity with the language and explore some simple libraries.
